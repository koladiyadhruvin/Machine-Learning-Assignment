# Applied Machine Learning In Python

## Overview
This repository showcases the application of machine learning techniques in Python to solve a specific problem or address a particular scenario. The primary focus is on how machine learning works on datasets and learn the parameters through different types of models and algorithm that give the accuracy of predicted parameters in real life examples to solve the problems.

## Libraries Used
- **Numpy** :- For numerical operations on the data.
- **Pandas** :- For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn** :- For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn** :- For machine learning algorithms and tools.

## Files and Directories

- **`scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Includes the dataset used in the analysis.
- **`models/`**: Stores trained machine learning models.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration and analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project and run the applied machine learning tasks on your local machine.

1. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for interactive analysis.

## Features
- Every notebooks contains the different types of algorithms, tools and techniques according to situation of methods of solving the different types of problem statements.
- Here, Assessment file contains the unsupervised machine learning algorithm to calculate the log loss.
