    "1. Split the data into `train_df` (60%) and `test_df` (40%) with `random_state = 42`. Keep the target column (`income`) in the splits so that we can use it in the exploratory data analysis.  \n",

    "_Usually having more data for training is a good idea. But here I'm using 60%/40% split because this is kind of a big dataset for a modest laptop. A smaller training data means it won't take too long to train the model on your laptop. A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the deployment performance!_"
